# UXResearch

Hello!

My name is Kelvin Chang. I am a dual-degree student at the University of Michigan Stephen M. Ross School of Business (Strategy) and School of Information (UX Design).

I am a UX Reseacher, a Culture Builder, and a Human Capital Consultant.

This is a repo for all my previous work in UX Research.

Thanks!
